### Hi, I'm Joelene! 👋

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying astrophysics and computer science at Western University in Ontario, Canada. 👩‍💻

- 🔭 I’ve spent the past 2.5 years developing software for astronomical data analysis, ranging from interstellar molecules to galaxies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ✨ Fun fact: In the winter, my family runs an ice fishing business on Lake Simcoe (which you can check out [here](https://link-url-here.org](https://timhalesfishhuts.com/)https://timhalesfishhuts.com/)! 🐟)
